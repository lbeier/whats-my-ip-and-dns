### What's my IP and DNS?
Simple Go application that uses ipleak.net API to get informations about IP and DNS.

#### Compiling for RaspberryPI
The main reason I did this was to retrieve information about my RaspberryPI IP and DNS. To compile to Raspberry, just run `make build-rasp`. The binary file will be in `build/ipleakrasp`.
